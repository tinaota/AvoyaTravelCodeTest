# The Test

This is a small front-end focused project to determine if candidates have basic skills required to
perform daily tasks on the product development team. It is not expected to complete all the work in the time allotted, do not spend more than 6 hours on this project.

Instructions:

1. Recreate the mock-up pdfs found in this directory using the NUXT/VUE 3 framework and Tailwindcss.

2. The hero is an automatic rotating slider with manual controls, please create a slider component from scratch do NOT use any third party libraries or components.

3. Use the assets in the asset folder to complete the layout, you should not need any other assets.

4. Use Vue's templating to render out the included comments object in app.json.

    - No changing of the original object is allowed, handle all data malformations and formatting with your code (assume that app.json is a response from an external API).

    - pay special attention to things like how the data is ordered and how every element is formatted.

5. The layout must be responsive, how specific elements on the page are rearranged should match the Figma designs for both mobile and desktop.

6. Make as many components as you feel are needed. Especially if something may be used repeatedly across several pages.

7. Add in the routes and placeholder pages for the other pages in the navbar do not add pages for the footer.

8. Limit this project to no more than 4-6 hours max. Pay attention to details, identify any and all tasks that would be needed to complete this project and be prepared to discuss what you accomplished and what is left to complete after the time limit is reached. Create a simple task list of uncompleted work and/or leave TODO comments in the code.

9. Make sure the project you submit passes both lint and vitest unit tests.

10. Track your progress with meaningful commits to the local git repo to show your work and time spent as well as to document what you changed and added or removed.

11. When finished, run a lighthouse report in Chrome and save the results to a file in the project. Make sure to make a final commit and zip up the project (remove node_modules and any other unneccessary folders/files) and send the zip file back to Avoya.
